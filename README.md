## Video-sharing-app backend.

### Backend for a social-network app. Mostly covers all basic functions such as:

- Login/register an account.
- Auth via JWT tokens.
- Being able to update stuff of your own profile.
- Follow/unfollow users.
- Upload/update a profile pic.
- Create posts with text, images or videos.
- Comment posts w/ text and images.
- Like/unlike posts and their comments.
- Feed made from what users you follow post.
- Feed made from your own posts.
- Feed made from your liked posts.
- Paginating for all of this kind of stuff.

### Would still like to do:

- Private messaging between users w/ websockets.
- Some sort of caching w/ Redis.
- Get better at testing and add proper testing to the project aside from having a postman collec.
- A nice looking front-end for the project.
